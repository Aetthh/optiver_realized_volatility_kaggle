# **Kaggle Challenge - Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction**

## **Overview**  
In this challenge, the objective was to build a model that predicts short-term volatility for hundreds of stocks across different sectors. The primary goal was to achieve a **reduction** in **RMSPE** and an **increase** in **R^2** compared to a naive model.

## **Challenge Description**

Please refer to this page for detailed information about the competition, including dataset details, evaluation metrics, and submission guidelines.

## **Notebook Contents**
This Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections:

1. Data Preprocessing: A thorough exploration and preprocessing of the provided datasets.
2. Feature Engineering: Creation of relevant features to improve model performance.
3. Model Building: Implementation of machine learning models and algorithms.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using RMSPE and R^2.
5. Conclusion: A summary of the results and potential areas for improvement.

## **Results**
After running the notebook, you will obtain insights into the model's performance in predicting short-term volatility for stocks. The primary metrics of interest are the reduction in RMSPE and the increase in R^2 compared to a naive model.
